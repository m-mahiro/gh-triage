# gh-triage

> **This is a fork of [k1LoW/gh-triage](https://github.com/k1LoW/gh-triage).**
>
> ### Changes from upstream
>
> - **Always fetch all notifications (`all=true`)**: The upstream version only fetches unread notifications by default, which caused `gh triage` to silently process zero notifications when the GitHub Web UI Inbox showed threads that were already read. This fork sets `All: true` in `ListNotifications` so all inbox notifications (read + unread) are fetched — matching the behaviour of the GitHub Web UI Inbox(All).
> - **`unread` field reflects actual state**: The upstream hardcodes `unread = true` for every notification. This fork replaces that with `n.GetUnread()` so the `unread` field accurately reflects whether a notification is unread. This makes conditions like `done: "!unread"` work as expected.

`gh-triage` is a tool that helps you manage and triage GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions through notifications. It fetches all notifications from your Inbox (including already-read ones, equivalent to `all=true` in the GitHub API), so conditions like `done: "!unread"` can match read notifications as well.

Key features of `gh-triage` are:

- **Done**: Mark Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions that match specified conditions as done
- **Read**: Mark Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions that match specified conditions as read
- **Unsubscribe**: Unsubscribe from notifications for Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions that match specified conditions
- **Open**: Open Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions that match specified conditions in a browser
- **List**: Display Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions that match specified conditions in a list

## Usage

```bash
$ gh triage
```

### Profile Support

`gh-triage` supports multiple configuration profiles. You can create different profiles for different workflows or environments.

#### Using Profiles

```bash
# Use default profile
$ gh triage

# Use specific profile
$ gh triage --profile work
$ gh triage -p personal
```

#### Profile Configuration Files

- Default profile: `default.yml`
- Named profiles: `{profile-name}.yml`

For example:
- `~/.local/share/gh-triage/default.yml` (default profile)
- `~/.local/share/gh-triage/work.yml` (work profile)
- `~/.local/share/gh-triage/personal.yml` (personal profile)

## Install

### Install this fork (m-mahiro/gh-triage)

```bash
# Clone the repository and install from source
git clone https://github.com/m-mahiro/gh-triage.git
cd gh-triage
gh extension install .
```

If you already have `k1LoW/gh-triage` (or another version) installed, remove it first:

```bash
gh extension remove triage
git clone https://github.com/m-mahiro/gh-triage.git
cd gh-triage
gh extension install .
```

### Install upstream (k1LoW/gh-triage)

```bash
$ gh extension install k1LoW/gh-triage
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at:

- `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/gh-triage/default.yml` (if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set)
- OR `~/.local/share/gh-triage/default.yml` (default location)

It will be automatically created on first run.

### Configuration File Migration

If you are upgrading from a previous version, your existing `config.yml` will be automatically migrated to `default.yml` on first run. The migration process:

1. Checks if `default.yml` exists
2. If not, looks for the old `config.yml` file
3. If found, copies the content to `default.yml`
4. Removes the old `config.yml` file
5. Logs the migration process

This ensures a smooth transition without losing your existing configuration.

### Default configuration

```yaml
done:
  max: 1000
  conditions: # Auto-mark merged and closed PRs / issues as done
    - "merged"
    - "closed"

open:
  max: 1
  conditions: # Open PRs awaiting my review
    - "is_pull_request && me in reviewers && passed && !approved && open && !draft"

list:
  max: 1000
  conditions: # List all unread notifications
    - "*"
```

### Options

- `done`: Conditions and maximum number for marking as done
- `read`: Conditions and maximum number for marking as read
- `unsubscribe`: Conditions and maximum number for unsubscribing from notifications
- `open`: Conditions and maximum number for opening in browser
- `list`: Conditions and maximum number for listing

Each action has the following parameters:
- `max`: Maximum number of items to process at once
- `conditions`: Processing conditions (no processing if empty array)

## Condition Evaluation System

Conditions are evaluated using the [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) library. You can write conditions such as:

### Basic Conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - "merged"                    # Merged Pull Request
  - "closed"                    # Closed Issue/PR/Discussion
  - "approved"                  # Approved Pull Request
  - "is_pull_request"           # Pull Request
  - "is_issue"                  # Issue
  - "is_discussion"             # Discussion
  - "answered"                  # Answered Discussion
  - "state == 'open'"           # Open state
  - "passed"                    # All checks passed
```

### Complex Conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - "merged && approved"                   # Merged and approved
  - "is_pull_request && state == 'open'"   # Open Pull Request
  - "author == 'username'"                 # Created by specific user
  - "len(labels) > 0"                      # Has labels
```

### Array Operations

```yaml
conditions:
  - "'bug' in labels"                      # Has bug label
  - "'hotfix' in labels"                   # Has hotfix label
  - "len(assignees) > 0"                   # Has assignees
  - "'APPROVED' in review_states"          # Review states include approved
```

### Special Conditions

```yaml
conditions:
  - "*"                                    # Match all (always true)
```

## Usage Examples
